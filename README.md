Minimalist Wordpress Theme based on min css framework

This is a very minimalist theme I created for my own use, based on the smallest css framework mincss.  The goal of this project is to create a wordpress theme that is NOT VERY UGLY, but tiny and fast.

<ul>
  <li>Two menu section, one on top and one at the footer</li>
  <li>Top widget area for placing Custom HTML widget and customize heading design.</li>
  <li>Right side bar widget area.</li>
  <li>Three bottom widget area</li>
</ul>
